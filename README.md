# Development of wall functions for turbulent flows

The repository is structured as follows:
- *test_cases*: OpenFOAM simulation setups
- *notebooks*: Jupyter notebooks for post-processing of results and other visualizations

## Getting started

Compiling the wall function and running the test cases requires an installation of [OpenFOAM-v2012](https://openfoam.com/). Other releases might work as well but have not been tested.

To run a test case, create a *run* folder (ignored by version control), copy the case from *test_cases* to *run*, and execute the *Allrun* script.

```
mkdir -p run
cp -r test_cases/turbulentFlatPlate run/
cd run/turbulentFlatPlate
./Allrun
```

## Singularity

TODO
- add singularity container to make results reproducible

## References

The basic ideas of this work were first developed in the context of mass transfer at rising bubbles. Instead of the turbulent viscosity, the molecular diffusivity of a chemical species is corrected to mitigate the so-called high-Schmidt number problem. The profile function's parameter is determined by the species mass in an interface cell.

In the following reference, the ideas above were first implemented in OpenFOAM and applied to surfactant adsorption rising bubbles.

Instead of an analytical profile function, one can also use a machine learning model to correct diffusive and convective fluxes.

The following two PhD theses contain more detailed descriptions as well as more extensive parameter studies and applications than the references above. *pesci2019* focuses more on surfactants and mass transfer while *weiner2020* addresses the modeling principles and extensions to reactive mass transfer by means of machine learning.
